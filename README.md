## Stack choices

### API

> - Settled on spoonacular hoped for woolworths or equiv for product info.
> - No store api, currency converter used to convert spoonacular prices.

### Additional contraints

> - Free APIs are generaly limited
> - Front end application meant using a subscription API would be expensive/complex/un-safe.

### CSS framework

#### Materialize CSS

> - Responsive elements
> - Material design

## Challenges

> - Selecting the apis
> - Writing the code
> - styling the site
> - Collaborating and Git
> - Using a new css framework
> - Keeping design responsive and consistent
